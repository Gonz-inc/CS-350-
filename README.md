# CS-350 System Architecture and Technology.
**Overview**</br>This project demonstrates the skills that I gained from the CS-350 courses while working with microcontrols and starter code, to create a prototype for an automated air condition system.</br>
**Hardware**</br>
CC3220S-LAUNCHXL
## Features 
* LED indicator for heat element. 
* UART Serial line communication. 
* GPIO Button inputs. 
* Timer and interrupt fuctionality.</br>
## Project Details
What I think I did well was analyzing the desired deliverables and developing the necessary components needed to accomplish this project this included reading documentation and requirements, developing States, and listing inputs and outputs. 

Then construct a state diagram and finally implement the logic via coding.I could improve in the overall coding portion of the project as I reflected on the could and could have refactored the code to make it more understandable.

Tools and resources that I have added to my support network include. 
* GPIO Libaries and funcitons.
* I2C for the temperature sensors.
* UART2 for serial communication.
* Timer for implementing timing functionality.
* Interrupts for implementing interrupt functionality. 

I think that several skills can be transferred to other projects/coursework. The whole project analysis and problem-solving portion of the project will come in handy in any project or coursework by encouraging continuous learning methods. The second skill that will help me is using state machines which will come in handy in OOP programming.

I made this project maintainable by constructing dedicated functions and callback functions. I also included best practices for embedded systems that focus on resource utilization to prevent any issues related to memory/processing. To make this code readable, I used proper variable naming and commented on the code of what the coding is doing in general terms. And finally, this code is adaptable due to the dedicated functions which can be invoked in other locations or functions within the code.


## RoadMap
Possibly include real LEDs and use Modulations by possibly sperating the code files to better understand how coding with embedded systems work.
