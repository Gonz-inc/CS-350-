# CS-350 System Architecture and Technology.
**Overview**</br>This project demonstrates my skill that I gained from the CS-350 courses while working with microcontrols and starter code, to create a prototype for a automated air condition system.</br>
## Features 
* LED indicator for heat element. 
* UART Serial line communication. 
* GPIO Button inputs. 
* Timer and interrupt fuctionality.</br>
## Project Details
What i think 
## RoadMap
Possibly include real LEDs and use Modulations by possibly sperating the code files to better understand how coding with embedded systems work.
